#### Why I need sponsorship

##### 1. I'm just a human

Hanami Mastery is a non-standard project. I**t's all about supporting other great Open-Source work** and as usually if it comes to Open Source, **a lot of the work is never paid off**.

We all need to live our lifes though.

I am Ruby developer myself and a triple father. At the moment I need to work Full-Time as a developer to fulfill my family needs and no matter how much I'd love to move full-time to content creation, I cannot do it at the moment.

I am committed to evolve this project, so **if you want me to put more effort and more time into it**, well, I need your help with it.

##### 2. By supporting Hanami Mastery you support the whole Hanami ecosystem and related gems

At least 10% of ALL the income I get in any wey (excluding my regular developer's job) is transferred directly to support Open-Source world, starting from Hanami core team, then related libraries maintainers and contributors.

Here are rough plans of different income channels.

1. Github sponsorship
2. I'm actively looking for sponsorship from companies
3. Book creation (comming soon)
4. Consultations
5. Youtube channel
6. Online courses
7. Affiliate links

Sponsorhip is only a one pillar of strategical income - but extremely important one as it allows me get sustainable business and reinvestments from the start, when other channels are not possible to be build yet.

It means, that your sponsorship allows me to grow faster, and achieve additional sources of income sooner.

By helping Hanami Mastery now you're helping all the great developers that build Hanami project and related gem families from the start.

**Hanami Mastery is an Open startup** - which means, I keep all the income, our impact on Open Source world, investements and expenses public (or semi-public, I may restrict this information to my sponsors only in the future).

My personal financial life goal is to earn $8k per month to keep my and my family at the satisfactory level of comfort. After reaching that level, additional income I'll get in any way, will go mostly to support the Open-Source world.

I'd love to make Open Source projects an amazing place to work as a full-time job.
