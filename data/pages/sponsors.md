### Sponsorship channels

If you really enjoy my content or get benefits from it, you're welcome to support me, our [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Z5nwSfZrUO4NI_n9SY3uQ), and the whole HanamiMastery initiative by [sponsoring on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz) or sending a small donation.

**At least 10% of all profits** related to this project **I get in any way** is directly transferred to support Hanami's development.

- [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz)
- [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/swilgosz)

If you need different channel to sponsor this project, just let me know!

#### Why I need sponsorship

##### 1. I'm just a human

Hanami Mastery is a non-standard project. I**t's all about supporting other great Open-Source work** and as usually if it comes to Open Source, **a lot of the work is never paid off**.

We all need to live our lifes though.

I am Ruby developer myself and a triple father. At the moment I need to work Full-Time as a developer to fulfill my family needs and no matter how much I'd love to move full-time to content creation, I cannot do it at the moment.

I am committed to evolve this project, so **if you want me to put more effort and more time into it**, well, I need your help with it.

##### 2. By supporting Hanami Mastery you support the whole Hanami ecosystem and related gems

At least 10% of ALL the income I get in any wey (excluding my regular developer's job) is transferred directly to support Open-Source world, starting from Hanami core team, then related libraries maintainers and contributors.

Here are rough plans of different income channels.

1. Github sponsorship
2. I'm actively looking for sponsorship from companies
3. Book creation (comming soon)
4. Consultations
5. Youtube channel
6. Online courses
7. Affiliate links

Sponsorhip is only a one pillar of strategical income - but extremely important one as it allows me get sustainable business and reinvestments from the start, when other channels are not possible to be build yet.

It means, that your sponsorship allows me to grow faster, and achieve additional sources of income sooner.

By helping Hanami Mastery now you're helping all the great developers that build Hanami project and related gem families from the start.

**Hanami Mastery is an Open startup** - which means, I keep all the income, our impact on Open Source world, investements and expenses public (or semi-public, I may restrict this information to my sponsors only in the future).

My personal financial life goal is to earn $8k per month to keep my and my family at the satisfactory level of comfort. After reaching that level, additional income I'll get in any way, will go mostly to support the Open-Source world.

I'd love to make Open Source projects an amazing place to work as a full-time job.

### The Sponsorship History Log

Below I track the income and outcome of Hanami Mastery. How much support I got and how much support I gave.HM
Excluded stuff.

- **My Time** - Of course I completely don't count here my time put into the project. It would be ridiculous but trust me, you don't want to know how much it takes to prepare this content not being a native english speaker.
- Also, at the moment I'm only focusing on Github sponsorship tracking due to the lack of time. I skipped my investments and costs for delegating the work on Hanami Mastery website.
- **My income from regular developer's work** - It's not included except parts where I invest directly into the Hanami Mastery initiative. First because of NDA with my clients, and secondly, because it's used mostly to support my family, not this project.
