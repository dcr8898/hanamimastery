### About

Hi, I'm **Seb Wilgosz**, and I run [HanamiMastery](https://hanamimastery.com) to help you get into this project as easily as possible.

Among the others, I am an author of [Rails API course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-on-rails-api-the-complete-guide/) on Udemy and [Driggl blog](https://driggl.com).
