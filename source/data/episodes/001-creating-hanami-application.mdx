We're entering a new era in Ruby world, there are no doubts on that, because really soon
A completely rewritten Hanami framework will have it's next major release.
In this episode I'll show you how to create a brand new Hanami application using the prepared
[Hanami Application Template](https://github.com/hanami/hanami-2-application-template).

## The quick setup

It's super easy to setup a new project and with the Hanami team busy with the CLI for the project
things will soon be even easier. At the moment the process consists of 5 steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Run installation script
3. Rename example .env file
4. Run bundler
5. Create PG database

I'll cover them all in the article below

### Cloning the repository

First of all we need to create a brand new Hanami application by cloning the template repository into
a customized named folder of my application

```shell
g clone git@github.com:hanami/hanami-2-application-template.git hanami_mastery
cd hanami_mastery
```

### Running the installer

Next, run the installation script appending the command with your app name to rename all the default
instances to your customized application name.

```shell
bin/install hanami_mastery
```

This will rename all the occurences of the default AppPrototypeTest with the hanami_mastery in this case.

### Install dependencies


### Rename the sample .env file

To run the hanami project, we need the environment file collecting all the initial setttings for
our application to run in different environments. The tempalte comes with `.env-example` file
we need to copy during the inital setup and name it: `.env.develpment`


```shell
cp .env-example .env.development
```

### Install dependencies

To install dependencies, we need to run _bundler_ as in any other ruby application

```shell
bundle install
```

### Creating Postgres database

The default setup comes with postgres database configuration. Assuming you have the postgres-server
already installed - I do it on my Mac using [Postgresapp](https://postgresapp.com/) - we can easily
create the database configuration needed using `createdb` command

```shell
createdb hanami_mastery_development
```

The name of

## Put it all together

All the steps in one batch will look like this:

```shell
g clone git@github.com:hanami/hanami-2-application-template.git hanami_mastery
cd hanami_mastery
bin/install hanami_mastery
cp .env-example .env.development
bundle install
createdb hanami_mastery_development
```

## Summary

I personally like to be SOLID more than DRY when it comes to coding. This way I will write more code - and that's bad, as I'm lazy. However, at the same time, this code is more reliable, more scalable, testable, easy to read and maintain.

In Driggl, we want to keep things simple to easily introduce new developers and reduce the risk of unexpected bugs to be introduced.

Whenever the big project will need to be split into several independent microservices, our code will be ready for that!
